Commands for Auto Fill Control Interface
Entering Detector Settings
	set <num> <option> <value> - set detector option to value
		This command does not change the current detector settings. The options and values entered are stored
		until the user enters "write settings". Then the detector settings are updated.
		<num> - detector number 1-6 or chill
		<option> - detector setting that will be changed
					Short Hand  - Full Name 
					enabled 	- Fill Enabled 			> enable/disable nitrogen filling for detector
					schedule 	- Fill Schedule 		> times at which nitrogen filling will start, 
                                                            not valid for line chill
					timeout 	- Fill Timeout 			> total time the nitrogen valve is allowed to be open 
					minimum     - Minimum Fill Time		> minimum amount of time the nitrogen valve must be open in
                                                            minutes, not valid for line chill
					temp        - Detector Max Temperature > Temperature above which an error is will be set, errors
                                                                    only set when detector is enabled, not valid for line chill
					name 		- Detector Name			> name for the detector connected to the detector channel, 
                                                            not valid for line chill
                    logging     - Temperature Logging   > enable/disable the logging of the detector temperature
		<value> - value option will be set to
					Depends on the setting see below for special cases
					Short Hand	- Values
					enabled		- True/False
					schedule	- 24 hour time in format HH:MM, for multiple fills in one day 
                                    use a comma to seperate times '12:01,13:45'
					timeout		- minutes, intiger 1-60
					minimum		- minutes, intiger 1-60
					temp		- degrees K, intiger 1-400
					name		- string
		Example - set 1 enabled True -> Enables automatic filling of detector 1
				- set 3 timeout 4 -> sets detector 3 fill timeout to 4 minutes
				- set 6 schedule 7:50,9:13,22:44 -> set the filling schedule for detector 6 to 7:50am 9:13am and 10:44pm
							
Write Entered Detector Settings
	write settings - write the setting entered using the 'set' command to the detector configuration file.
	
Load the Detector Configuration file
	load settings - reads and loads the current detector configuration file
					used when the user directly edits the configuration file and wants to load the new settings
	
Displaying Current Settings
	get <num> - print the current settings for the entered detector number
		<num> - Detector number to print current settings, 1-6, chill, all 
		Example	- get 2 -> display all the current settings for detector 2

Display Current Detector Temperatures
	temp <num> - prints the detector temperature to screen
		<num> - detector channel number 1-6, 'all' can also be used and all temperatures will be displayed
		Example - temp all -> print all the current detector temperatures
				- temp 2 -> print the current temperatrue of detector 2

Display Graph of Recorded Detector Temperature
	graph <num> - shows a graph of the detector temperatures stored in the temperature log
		<num> - detector channel number, 1-6

Display and Clear Errors	
	error - print the error
	error clear - clear any errors that are currently active, if error coinditions still exists 
                    the specific error will continue to report

Enable/Disable Detector Temperature Logging
	logging <num> <value> - enable or disable temperature logging for specifided detector
		<num> - detector number 1-6
		<value> - True/False
		
Stop Filling Program
	stop - safely turns off the filling thread, closing valves and turning off all lights. 
            Command line interface will still be running
	
Start Filling Program
	start - starts filling thread

Exit the Filling Program
	exit - stops the fill thread then closes the command line interface
